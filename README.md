A set of API adapters to work with the GDS APIs, extracted from the frontend app.

Example usage:

    publisher_api = GdsApi::Publisher.new("environment")
    ostruct_publication = publisher.publication_for_slug('my-published-item')

    panopticon_api = GdsApi::Panopticon.new("environment")
    ostruct_metadata = panopticon_api.artefact_for_slug('my-published-item')

Very much still a work in progress.
